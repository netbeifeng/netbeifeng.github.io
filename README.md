# chang9luo.github.io

Personal homepage, served by GitHub Pages from `main`.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` / `index-ja.html` | English / Japanese pages. Bio and **News** are edited by hand. |
| `publications.toml` | **The only place to edit publications.** One card here → one entry on both pages. |
| `scripts/build_publications.py` | Renders the cards into both pages (between the `PUBLICATIONS:START/END` markers). |
| `.github/workflows/static.yml` | On every push: runs the script, commits the regenerated pages if needed, deploys. |

## Adding a publication

1. Put the thumbnail in `images/` and the PDF in `data/`.
2. Append a card to `publications.toml` (cards appear in file order, so put newest first):

   ```toml
   [[publications]]
   image   = "images/mypaper.gif"        # image_width = 190 by default
   title   = "MyPaper: Something Great"
   authors = ["me", "umetani"]           # keys from [people]; add "*" for equal contribution
   venue   = { en = "Proceedings of X (<b>X</b>)", ja = "X (<b>X</b>) 予稿集" }
   year    = 2027                        # optional

   [publications.links]                  # keys from [link_labels]; order = display order
   paper   = "data/mypaper.pdf"
   arxiv   = "https://arxiv.org/abs/..."
   website = "./MyPaper/"
   code    = "https://github.com/chang9luo/mypaper"
   ```

   New coauthor? Add a `[people.<key>]` block. New kind of link? Add it to `[link_labels]`.
   Any text field takes either a plain string or `{ en = "...", ja = "..." }`.
3. Push. The GitHub Action regenerates both pages and deploys.

To preview locally first (Python 3.11+, no packages needed):

```sh
python3 scripts/build_publications.py          # rewrites index.html and index-ja.html
python3 scripts/build_publications.py --check  # only reports whether they are stale
```

Running it locally before pushing is recommended: then the Action finds nothing to commit and
you never need to `git pull` a bot commit. Never edit the block between the
`PUBLICATIONS:START` and `PUBLICATIONS:END` comments by hand; it is overwritten on every build.
